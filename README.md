In this assignment, we created a database that held 10 items and info about each item.

Each row of items included...
1. The ID of the item
2. The product name
3. Department name
4. Price of each item
5. Quantity of stock left for purchase


The goal of this assignment is to allow the user to select an item and deduct whatever amount they selected from the avaliable stock of that item, and give them a result back for their order.
